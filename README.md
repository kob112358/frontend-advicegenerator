**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I decided to start working on the README from the get go this project, and document my hiccups along the way.
-I learned how to manipulate SVGs for this to create the background for the circle
-Positioning my SVG background/Dice on the screen went muuuch smoother than previous projects.
-Overall this was a very smooth project. I'm curious to learn more about the proper method of fetching API's with React.
